---

A GitHub Action that listens for a `/assign-me` "command" (an issue comment that starts with `/assign-me` or a specific trigger) and assigns the issue to the user who commented (or the user who triggered the action
It can also unassign issues that have been assigned for a configured amount of time.

This Action is heavily inspired by [JasonEtco/slash-assign-action](https://github.com/JasonEtco/slash-assign-action)

## üöÄ Usage

Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/assign.yml` learn more about [Creating a Workflow file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows#creating-a-workflow-file)) to utilize the `trigger` action with content:

```yaml
name: Assign Issue Action

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 * * *
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  assign:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Assign the user or unassign stale assignments
        uses: takanome-dev/assign-issue-action@v2.0.0
        with:
          github_token: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
          # trigger: '/assign-me' # you can change the default trigger to something else
          # required_label: help wanted # if present, the issue must have this label to be assigned
          # assigned_label: Assigned
          # days_until_unassign: 7
          # learn more about the inputs below ‚¨á
```
