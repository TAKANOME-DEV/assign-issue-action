---

A GitHub Action that listens for a `/assign-to-me` "command" (an issue comment that starts with `/assign-to-me`) and assigns the commenter to the issue. It can also unassign issues that have been assigned for a configured amount of time.

This Action is heavily inspired by [JasonEtco/slash-assign-action](https://github.com/JasonEtco/slash-assign-action)

## Usage

Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/assign-to-me.yml` learn more about [Creating a Workflow file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows#creating-a-workflow-file)) to utilize the `assign-to-me` action with content:

```yaml
name: Assign To Me Action

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 * * *
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  assign:
    # If the acton was triggered by a new comment that starts with `/assign-to-me`
    # or a on a schedule
    if: >
      (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '/assign-to-me')) ||
      github.event_name == 'schedule'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Assign the user or unassign stale assignments
        uses: takanome-dev/assign-to-me-action@v1.0.1
        with:
          github_token: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
          required_label: good-first-issue # you can change this label if you wish
          assigned_label: Is-Assigned # you can change this label if you wish
```

## Inputs

Various inputs are defined in action.yml to let you configure the action:

| Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Default                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `pin_label`           | A label that prevents the user from being unassigned, typically for issues that are expected to take a long time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `Pinned`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `assigned_comment`    | The comment posted after a user has assigned themselves to an issue. This is a Mustache template that supports the following variables: - `inputs` (the inputs given to the action) - `comment` (an object of the comment that was created) - `totalDays` (`days_until_warning` + `days_until_unassign`) - `env` (`process.env`, anything you pass to the action via `env`) | `This issue [has been assigned]({{ comment.html_url }}) to {{ comment.user.login }}! It will become unassigned if it isn't closed within {{ totalDays }} days. A maintainer can also add the **{{ inputs.pin_label }}** label to prevent it from being unassigned.` |

## `workflow_dispatch` trigger

You can also manually trigger this action via the `workflow_dispatch` event. You'll need to modify the `if` property:

```yaml
if: >
  (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '/assign')) ||
  github.event_name == 'schedule' || github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'
```
