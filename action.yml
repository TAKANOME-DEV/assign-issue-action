      This is a Mustache template that supports the following variables:
        * `inputs` (the inputs given to the action)
        * `comment` (an object of the comment that was created)
        * `totalDays` (7 days)
        * `env` (`process.env`, anything you pass to the action via `env`)
    default: |
      This issue [has been assigned]({{ comment.html_url }}) to @{{ comment.user.login }}!
      It will become unassigned if it isn't closed within {{ totalDays }} days. 
      A maintainer can also add the **{{ inputs.pin_label }}** label to prevent it from being unassigned.
